# HackerRank Questions in C 🚀  

This repository contains my daily solutions to **HackerRank** coding problems, all written in **C**. Each solution includes the **problem statement and sample test cases** in comments before the actual implementation.  
## 🔥 About
- Solving HackerRank questions daily using C

- Covering multiple topics: Algorithms, Data Structures, Pointers, Strings, Recursion, Control Construct[if-else, looping, jump], etc.

## 🔥 Structure of Solutions  
Each file follows this format:  
1. **Problem Statement** (as comments)  
2. **Sample Input/Output** (as comments)  
3. **Solution in C**  

## Example File Structure:  
```c
/*
    Problem: Sum of Two Numbers  
    Given two integers, return their sum.

    Sample Input:  
    5 7  

    Sample Output:  
    12  
*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    printf("%d\n", a + b);
    return 0;
}
```
